Blazer eliminates the need for many admin pages

Works with PostgreSQL and MySQL

:tangerine: Battle-tested at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/opensource)

## Features

- **Secure** - works with your authentication system
- **Variables** - run the same queries with different values
- **Linked Columns** - link to other pages in your apps or around the web (Check the examples in config/blazer.yml)
- **Smart Columns** - get the data you want without all the joins (Check the examples in config/blazer.yml)
- **Smart Variables** - no need to remember ids (Check the examples in config/blazer.yml)
- **Charts** - visualize the data
- **Audits** - all queries are tracked

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'blazer'
```

Run:

```sh
rails g blazer:install
rake db:migrate
```

And mount the dashboard in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Blazer::Engine, at: "blazer"
```

For production, specify your database:

```ruby
ENV["BLAZER_DATABASE_URL"] = "postgres://user:password@hostname:5432/database_name"
```

It is **highly, highly recommended** to use a read only user.  Keep reading to see how to create one.

## Permissions

### PostgreSQL

Create a user with read only permissions:

```sql
BEGIN;
CREATE ROLE blazer LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret123';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name TO blazer;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO blazer;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO blazer;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO blazer;
COMMIT;
```

It is **highly, highly recommended** to protect sensitive information with views.  Documentation coming soon.

### MySQL

Create a user with read only permissions:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON database_name.* TO blazer@’127.0.0.1′ IDENTIFIED BY ‘secret123‘;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

It is **highly, highly recommended** to protect sensitive information with views.  Documentation coming soon.

## Authentication

Don’t forget to protect the dashboard in production.

### Basic Authentication

Set the following variables in your environment or an initializer.

```ruby
ENV["BLAZER_USERNAME"] = "andrew"
ENV["BLAZER_PASSWORD"] = "secret"
```

### Devise

```ruby
authenticate :user, lambda{|user| user.admin? } do
  mount Blazer::Engine, at: "blazer"
end
```

## Customization

Change time zone

```ruby
Blazer.time_zone = "Pacific Time (US & Canada)"
```

Change timeout *PostgreSQL only*

```ruby
Blazer.timeout = 10 # defaults to 15
```

Turn off audits

```ruby
Blazer.audit = false
```

Custom user class

```ruby
Blazer.user_class = "Admin"
```

Customize user name

```ruby
Blazer.user_name = :first_name
```

## Charts

Blazer will automatically generate charts based on the types of the columns returned in your query

### Line Chart

If there are at least 2 columns and the first is a timestamp and all other columns are numeric, a line chart will be generated

### Pie Chart

If there are 2 columns and the first column is a string and the second column is a numeric, a pie chart will be generated

## TODO

- better readme
- better navigation
- standalone version
- update lock
- warn when database user has write permissions
- advanced permissions
- maps
- favorites
- support for multiple data sources
